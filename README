History :
======
Since 2007, I have used the XRMS ticket system for administrating invoices & repair tickets at my computer repair shop. This software has sadly fallen out of support from it's original developers via Sourceforge.  From the time of it's 
initial implimentation it has served it's purpose.  However the software is largly designed for much more than my shop utilizes.  What we needed was an encredibly stripped down version to just handle tickets, customers, & users.  After
spending months looking on the web for software, I became distraught with the amount of 'simple' implimentations that still required some Java plug-in, or other software additions.  There is no reason why this can't just be implimneted
with PHP/Mysql.

Because the XRMS software was written on PHP4, maintaing our customized instalation just got to the point that I have given up.  It is my opinion that it will be far easier to re-write the entire system to include the Twitter Bootstrap, 
email notifications, & continue to imporove on the functionality that I have already added to the XRMS code base.

After being unable to find software simple enough to impliment, & light weight enough to use, I got with Sean & we decided to just write it ourselves.  We will offer our new ticket software creation to the world to use, much the same
as wordpress.
